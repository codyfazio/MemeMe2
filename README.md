# MemeMe2

This is the second portfolio project for Udacity's iOS Nanodegree.

This app enables a user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme. The user is then able to share the photo on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email.

In the future, I plan to make this app persistent using Core Data. 

If you have any questions or suggestions to make this app better, please let me know!
